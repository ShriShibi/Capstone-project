## Machine Learning and Vision for Waste Management System

### Project Description and objective

Using Machine Learning and Machine Vision tools, detect and report events of interest recorded by cameras installed on trucks in the waste management industry. The objective is to identify in real-time key events and generate alerts for a vehicle operations monitoring system. Examples of interesting events are people or animals in front of the vehicle, bins being picked up and lifted, and unexpected scenarios.

As the vehicles operate outdoor under all weather conditions, external factors such as lighting and precipitation can influence outcomes.

The objective is to solve real world problems currently encountered in the waste management industry using advanced ML and MV algorithms.

Data sets and programming tools will be provided.
